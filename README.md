# XenonStack Assignment : Ecommerce website

I have create a Ecommerce website using ReactJs,Html,and Css.The first page that open is Home page

## Home Page

In the Home page You have:

### Navbar

Navbar has  company's name/logo on left side and has links on right side that provide different pages in your React app, including Home, Contact, and Login.

### Search bar

The next part is a search bar added to search Products

### demo products
 
 the last part are demo Products with Prices , description and a add to cart  button but you can only add products after login.

## Login Page

The second is Login Page.you can only access login page  after logout if you have logged in once.the logout button will be shown in the same position as login button previously.A alert message is shown on successful login.

## Logout Page
For Logout I have used a pop up window to confirm whether user wants to logout or not.

## Contact Page
The Third page is Contact Page .You can send message with your email and name to the company for any questions or remarks.

## Backend
  For Backend I have used NodeJs,ExpressJs,Cors and MongoDB atlas.
  All the data from  contact Page and Login Page is send to the collections in mongodb database.

## Api

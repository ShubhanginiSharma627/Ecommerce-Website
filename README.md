# Ecommerce website

I have created an Ecommerce website using ReactJs, Html, and CSS. The first page that opens is the Home page

## Home Page

On the Home page, You have the:

### Navbar

Navbar has the company's name/logo on the left side and has links on the right side that provide different pages in your React app, including Home, Contact, and Login.

### Search bar

The next part is a search bar added to search Products

### demo products
 
 the last part is demo Products with Prices, a description, and an add-to-cart button but you can only add products after login.

## Login Page

The second is Login Page. You can only access the login page after logout if you have logged in once. The logout button will be shown in the same position as the login button previously. An alert message is shown on successful login.

## Logout Page
For Logout, I have used a pop-up window to confirm whether the user wants to log out or not.

## Contact Page
The Third page is Contact Page. You can send a message with your email and name to the company for any questions or remarks.

## Backend
  For the Backend, I have used NodeJs, ExpressJs, Cors, and MongoDB atlas.
  All the data from the contact Page and Login Page is sent to the collections in the MongoDB database.

## Api
 For Api's, I have used axios for sending data from a website to MongoDB.
